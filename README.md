# Hangman

A basic game of Hangman using [Bevy](bevyengine.org).

Currently, only uses hardcoded words but could take input from stdin or pick
from [this][wordlist] massive word-list.

It also doesn't display what letters were already picked, and doesn't terminate
the game on a win or loss properly.
